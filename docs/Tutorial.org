* Installation 

The most convinient way to get PSIXAS to run is to use PSI4 via 
conda or miniconda. Let's assume you created a new environment:

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
conda create -n p4env psi4 -c psi4
conda activate p4env
#+END_SRC
which will install the most recent stable PSI4.

Then you can checkout the PSIXAS repository into the directory where all your PSI4
plugins are located:
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
git clone https://github.com/Masterluke87/psixas
cd psixas

$(psi4 --plugin-compile)
make
#+END_SRC
If you do not want to build the master branch version, you can checkout
 another branch:
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
git checkout PSIXAS-1.0
#+END_SRC

After the plugin one needs to export the path that contains the plugin:
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
export PYTHONPATH=/path/to/psi4Plugins
#+END_SRC

Then the installation is complete, and PSIXAS is ready to run!
